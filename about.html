  <body>
    This site is intended to be not just a portal to interesting content and
    ideas for You, the reader, but also intended to be a learning experience for
    me, about ways to push the envelope with web technology and product creation
    and brand management in general. To that end, especially while this is in
    development, it will be a constantly novel product; reinventing itself
    often. Over time, certain features will stick and generally persist, while
    others will remain more dynamic. In order to 
    <span class="reason">(A) Get Feedback,</span> and 
    <span class="reason">(B) Keep myself organized,</span>
    I'll be using this page as a record, notekeeper, etc. As things become more
    finalized, they'll be removed, so the section below is definitely dynamic.
